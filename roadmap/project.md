Sure! Here's a list of simple projects you can work on each day, corresponding to the topics in the roadmap:

### Week 1: Introduction and Basics

**Day 1-2: Introduction to Node.js**

- Project: Create a basic "Hello World" web server that returns a plain text response.

**Day 3-4: Basic Node.js Modules**

- Project: Build a simple file server that serves static files from a directory.
  - Use the `fs` and `http` modules to read and serve files.

**Day 5-7: Asynchronous Programming**

- Project: Create a basic RESTful API with two endpoints.
  - One endpoint reads data from a file asynchronously.
  - Another endpoint writes data to a file asynchronously.

### Week 2: Building and Working with Modules

**Day 8-9: Modularization**

- Project: Refactor the previous RESTful API to use separate modules for file operations.

**Day 10-12: NPM (Node Package Manager)**

- Project: Build a simple command-line tool using an npm package (e.g., `yargs` for argument parsing).
  - The tool could read and write JSON data to a file.

**Day 13-14: File System**

- Project: Create a script that reads a directory and lists all files and their sizes.
  - Use the `fs` module and asynchronous functions.

### Week 3: Building Web Applications

**Day 15-17: HTTP and Web Servers**

- Project: Develop a basic CRUD application for managing a list of items (e.g., a to-do list).
  - Implement routes to create, read, update, and delete items.

**Day 18-20: Express.js Framework**

- Project: Convert the previous CRUD application to use Express.js.
  - Add middleware for logging and error handling.

**Day 21: Templating Engines**

- Project: Add a templating engine (e.g., EJS) to the Express.js CRUD application.
  - Create views for listing items and forms for adding/editing items.

### Week 4: Database Integration and Advanced Topics

**Day 22-24: Databases**

- Project: Connect the CRUD application to a MongoDB database using Mongoose.
  - Replace in-memory data storage with MongoDB.

**Day 25-26: Authentication and Security**

- Project: Implement user authentication in the CRUD application.
  - Use Passport.js to handle user registration and login.
  - Protect routes to ensure only authenticated users can access them.

**Day 27-28: RESTful APIs**

- Project: Create a RESTful API for the CRUD application with Express.
  - Implement endpoints to manage items.
  - Test the API using Postman.

**Day 29: Error Handling and Debugging**

- Project: Enhance the CRUD application with robust error handling.
  - Add custom error messages and use a logging library.
  - Debug the application using tools like `node-inspector`.

**Day 30: Deployment**

- Project: Deploy the CRUD application to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku).
  - Use environment variables for configuration.
  - Use PM2 to manage the Node.js process.

### Additional Tips

- Document each project with a README file explaining how to set up and run it.
- Use version control (e.g., Git) to manage your code and track progress.
- Explore additional features and improvements for each project to deepen your understanding.

Working on these projects will help you apply the concepts you learn each day and build a practical portfolio of Node.js applications.
