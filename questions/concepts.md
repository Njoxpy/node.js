Here are some practical questions based on the Node.js module system, npm, and building RESTful APIs using Express:

### Node Module System

1. **Creating and Exporting Modules:**

   - Write a Node.js module that exports a function to calculate the area of a circle. Use this module in another file to calculate and log the area of a circle with a given radius.

2. **Loading Core Modules:**

   - Create a Node.js script that reads the contents of a directory and logs them to the console. Use the `fs` and `path` core modules to achieve this.

3. **Using the Module Wrapper Function:**
   - Explain how the module wrapper function works in Node.js. Create a simple module and demonstrate how variables inside the module are scoped locally.

### npm

1. **Initializing a Project:**

   - Initialize a new Node.js project using `npm init`. Install the `lodash` package and use it to perform a deep clone of an object. Log the original and the cloned objects to demonstrate that they are indeed separate instances.

2. **Managing Dependencies:**

   - Create a simple Node.js application that uses the `axios` package to make a GET request to a public API. Log the response data to the console. Ensure `axios` is listed as a dependency in your `package.json`.

3. **Creating and Publishing a Package:**
   - Create a simple utility package that provides a function to format dates in a human-readable way. Write tests for your package using a testing framework like `mocha` or `jest`. Publish your package to the npm registry.

### Building RESTful APIs using Express

1. **Setting Up Express:**

   - Create a basic Express server that listens on port 3000 and responds with "Hello World" to GET requests made to the root URL (`/`).

2. **Defining Routes:**

   - Extend your Express server to handle CRUD operations for a resource called `books`. Implement routes to create, read, update, and delete books. Use an in-memory array to store book data.

3. **Middleware:**

   - Add middleware to your Express server to log the request method and URL for each incoming request. Also, add error-handling middleware to catch and respond to errors gracefully.

4. **Connecting to a Database:**

   - Modify your Express server to connect to a MongoDB database using Mongoose. Define a Book schema and model, and update your CRUD routes to interact with the MongoDB database instead of the in-memory array.

5. **Authentication:**
   - Implement user authentication in your Express server using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). Create a route for user registration and login. Protect certain routes so that only authenticated users can access them.

### Bonus Questions

1. **Deploying Your Application:**

   - Describe the steps required to deploy your Express application to a cloud service provider like Heroku or AWS. What configurations and environment variables would you need to set?

2. **Testing:**
   - Write unit tests for your Express routes using a testing framework like `mocha` or `jest` along with `supertest`. Ensure your tests cover all CRUD operations for the `books` resource.

Sure! Here are some additional practical questions:

### Node Module System

1. **Asynchronous Modules:**

   - Create a Node.js module that performs an asynchronous operation, such as reading a file using `fs.promises.readFile`. Export this function and use it in another file to read and log the contents of the file.

2. **Custom Modules and Dependency Injection:**

   - Create a custom Node.js module that depends on another module. Use dependency injection to pass an instance of the dependent module to your custom module. Demonstrate how to mock the dependency for testing purposes.

3. **Module Caching:**
   - Explain how module caching works in Node.js. Create two modules where one depends on the other. Modify the dependency module after the first module has been loaded and observe how the changes affect the dependent module.

### npm

1. **Script Commands:**

   - Add custom script commands to your `package.json`. For example, create a `start` script that runs your application and a `test` script that runs your tests. Use `npm run` to execute these scripts.

2. **Version Management:**

   - Use `npm` to update a package to the latest version and then revert it to a specific version. Demonstrate how to check the currently installed version of a package and how to view the packageâ€™s version history.

3. **Local vs Global Packages:**
   - Explain the difference between installing a package locally and globally. Install a package both ways and demonstrate how to use the globally installed package from the command line.

### Building RESTful APIs using Express

1. **Request Validation:**

   - Implement request validation in your Express API using a library like `express-validator` or `joi`. Ensure that your API validates request data and returns appropriate error responses for invalid data.

2. **Pagination:**

   - Add pagination support to your API for the `books` resource. Implement query parameters to specify the page number and page size. Modify the route handler to return only the items for the requested page.

3. **Rate Limiting:**

   - Implement rate limiting in your Express API to prevent abuse. Use a library like `express-rate-limit` to limit the number of requests a client can make in a given time period.

4. **API Documentation:**

   - Add documentation for your API endpoints using Swagger or a similar tool. Create a documentation page that describes the available endpoints, request parameters, and response formats.

5. **CORS Configuration:**

   - Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in your Express application to allow requests from specific origins. Demonstrate how to use the `cors` middleware to manage CORS settings.

6. **Data Validation and Sanitization:**

   - Integrate data validation and sanitization into your API using libraries like `validator` or `express-validator`. Ensure that user inputs are properly validated and sanitized before processing.

7. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - Implement comprehensive error handling and logging in your Express application. Use a logging library like `winston` or `morgan` to record errors and request details, and set up error-handling middleware to send appropriate responses.
